# Personal Website
###  I made the perfect combination of things i love the most: Programming and Persona 5 Royal. 
<p> Developing this portfolio was such a good experience of making mistakes, learning from them, being able to search for improvements for my application, learn new things and use a lot of my creativity to develop something that im proud of.  </p>
